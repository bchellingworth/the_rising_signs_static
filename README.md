1) clone repo
2) npm install
3) run `gulp` for one off compilation
4) run `gulp watcher` to watch scss for auto copilation
5) We are still waiting on images from the designer so for now just use `sigil.png` as a placeholder.
6) For icons just pick something as close as you can from https://material.io/resources/icons/?icon=keyboard_arrow_right&style=baseline. again, we are waiting on actual icons from the designer
